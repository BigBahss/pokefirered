# Changes made to pokefirered original

1. Add Physical/Special split as seen in Gen 4 onward. Currently this change has no visual indication in game (such showing move physicality in the Pokemon summary screen). Therefore it is currently up to the player to know whether a move is physical, special, or other.

2. Add simple debug menu in debug builds of the game. The menu is opened by pressing R+Start. The menu options are as follows:
- Turn wild encounters on/off
- Give Stuff: Gives max money, 99 Rare Candies & Master Balls, a Lv100 Mew, all HM's, and all badges.
- Warp to Mt Silver (Route 28 and Mt Silver are a work in progress)

3. The player can run indoors.

4. PokeMart inventories are now determined by the number of badges the player has, and every PokeMart will have the same selection. The only exception to this is the department store in Celadon City, which is currently unchanged.

5. Effort values (EV's) are now capped to 252 per stat instead of 255. This change prevents wasted EV's.

6. Default text speed is set to fast.

7. Player looks down after healing at Pokemon Centers.

8. Add option to nickname pokemon from the party menu screen.

9. Change default button mode to LR (disables the annoying help menu).

10. Start the game with the running shoes.

11. Add Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee, Premier Ball shop system (get 1 for every 10 balls purchased).

12. Add auto-run feature by pressing L.

13. Add Gen IV's overworld poison system (Poison fades away and leaves the Pokemon with 1 HP).

14. Add wrap-around Pokemon summary screens (When scrolling through Pokemon the last will wrap-around to the first, and vice-versa).
