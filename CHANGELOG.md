# Changes made to pokefirered original

1. Added Physical/Special split as seen in Gen 4 onward. Currently this change has no visual indication in game (such showing move physicality in the Pokemon summary screen). Therefore it is currently up to the player to know whether a move is physical, special, or other.

2. Added a simple debug menu in debug builds of the game. The menu is opened by pressing R+Start. The menu options are as follows:
- Turn wild encounters on/off
- Give 99 Rare Candies
- Give 99 Master Balls
- Warp to Route 28 (Route 28 and Mt Silver are a work in progress)

3. The player can run indoors.

4. PokeMart iventories are now determined by the number of badges the player has, and every PokeMart will have the same selection. The only exception to this is the department store in Celadon City, which is currently unchanged.

5. Effort values (EV's) are now capped to 252 per stat instead of 255. This change prevents wasted EV's.

6. Default text speed is set to fast.

7. Player looks down after healing at Pokemon Centers.

8. Add option to nickname pokemon from the party menu screen.

9. Change default button mode to LR (disables the annoying help menu).

10. Start the game with the running shoes.
